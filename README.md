# Computer Vision Fall 2024
A repository of my lectures on Computer Vision (CV) in the fall of 2024.

These lectures are part of the Minor Applied Artificial Intelligence.
In this minor we give these lectures so students have a basic understanding of CV.
Other lecturers do topics like Machine Learing, Data Science, Math & Statistics, NLP etc.

The lecture slides are in Dutch. The accompanying notebooks, however, are in English. 

### Lecture 1: Best of Computer Vision
