# Computer Vision Fall 2024
A repository of my lectures on Computer Vision (CV) in the fall of 2024.

These lectures are part of the Minor Applied Artificial Intelligence.
In this minor we give these lectures so students have a basic understanding of CV.
Other lecturers do topics like Machine Learing, Data Science, Math & Statistics, NLP etc.

The lecture slides are in Dutch. The accompanying notebooks, however, are in English. 

### Lecture 1: Best of Computer Vision
- Duration of lecture: 4 hours
- Topics: CNN's, Image Embeddings, Vision Language Models
- Notebooks

     
### Lecture 2: CV classics
- Duration of lecture: 2 hours
- Topics: Preprocessing images with Numpy and OpenCV
- Notebooks
  
### Lecture 3: GenAI for images
- Duration of lecture: 2 hours
- Topics: (Variational) Autoencoders and Diffusion Models
- Notebooks
  
### Lecture 4: From Deep Learning to Foundation Models
- Duration of lecture: 4 hours
- Topics: Segmentation and Object Detection, ResNet, Vision Language Models, Foundation Models for Vision
- Notebooks

### Python packages used.
- Keras 3
- Torch
- Numpy (1 and 2)
- Huggingface Datasets and Transformers
- SciKit learn
- Specific packages such as OpenCV, YOLO, etc etc.
