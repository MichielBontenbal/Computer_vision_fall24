# Computer Vision Fall 2024
A repository of my lectures on Computer Vision (CV) in the fall of 2024.

These lectures are part of the Minor Applied Artificial Intelligence.

With the lessons (12 hour in total) students just get a basic introduction to CV. 
Other lecturers do topics like Machine Learing, Data Science, Math & Statistics, NLP etc.

The lecture slides are in Dutch. The accompanying notebooks are in English. 

### Lecture 1: Best of Computer Vision
- Duration of lecture: 4 hours
- Topics: CNN's, Image Embeddings, Vision Language Models
- Notebooks:
  - MNIST_CNN
  - Image similarity and clustering
  - Ollama LLaVA challenge    

### Lecture 2: CV classics
- Duration of lecture: 2 hours
- Topics: Preprocessing images with Numpy and OpenCV
- Notebooks:
  - Numpy for images
  - OpenCV 
  
### Lecture 3: GenAI for images
- Duration of lecture: 2 hours
- Topics: (Variational) Autoencoders and Diffusion Models
- Notebooks:
  - Variational Autoencoder
  - Huggingface diffusers
  
### Lecture 4: From Deep Learning to Foundation Models
- Duration of lecture: 4 hours
- Topics: Segmentation and Object Detection, ResNet, Vision Language Models, Foundation Models for Vision
- Notebooks:
  - Segment Anything with transformers
  - YOLO
